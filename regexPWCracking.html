			This shows how long a brute force attack* that tries every combination will take to crack you password. <br>
			It takes the time based on how long you password is, and what sort of characters you use to make it. <br>
			Some hackers have computers that can make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/"> 350,000,000,000 guesses per second! </a> <br>
			See how long it will take a secure password to become considerably less secure! <br> 
			Moore's law states that a computer doubles in power every few years!** <br> <br>
